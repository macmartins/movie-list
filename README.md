## Dependencies
- NPM

## Setup

### **Repository**

To setup this application, let's first clone the repository using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/macmartins/movie-list.git`

### **Server**

After we have a local copy, let's handle the server setup:

1. Opening any CLI in the root of the project, install the server dependencies using: `npm install`
2. Then to run the server do: `npm start`

After a few seconds, you should see something like this:
![Server running in a CLI](/assets/images/serverCLI.png)

Nice! The server is working!

### **Client**

Last but not least, let's handle the client setup:
1. Open another CLI window, navigate to the client folder using: `cd client`
2. Then, install the app dependencies using: `npm install`
3. Lastly, run the client app using: `npm start`

After a few seconds, you should see something like this:

Great! The application is up and running!
Just click/paste the URL and start using the application!
